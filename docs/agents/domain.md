# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. If the concept is absent, either reconsider the wording or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

Surface an explicit conflict with an existing ADR rather than silently overriding it.
